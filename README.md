This project utilizes raw fastq barcode reads, maps, screens and drops human reads (host reads) and taxonomically classifies the resulting reads

The pipeline is built using Nextflow, a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with singularity and docker containers, making installation of tools and running quite easy
